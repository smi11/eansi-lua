# `eansi.lua`

[![License](https://img.shields.io/:license-mit-blue.svg)](https://mit-license.org)

Convert strings describing ANSI colors to extended ANSI escape sequences.
It supports 3,4,8 and 24 bit ANSI escape sequences and thus enabling 8, 16, 256
and 16M colors, depending on your terminal capabilities.

Color tags, html tags for bold, italic and underline, simple palette handling,
optional caching, saving states, etc.. Highly customizable.

See: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code>

## Usage

```
local eansi = require "eansi"

-- settings
eansi.enable = true   -- colors enabled (default false on windows, true on any other os)
eansi.errors = true   -- raise error on invalid color (default true)
eansi.cache = false   -- use caching (defult false)
eansi.tag = "$%b{}"   -- regex for color tags

-- basic methods
eansi.toansi(string)     -- converts string describing colors to ANSI escape sequence
                         -- if eansi.cache is true this function is memoized
eansi.paint(string)      -- convers string with color tags to ANSI escaped string
                         -- also appends ANSI reset sequence before and after string
eansi.rawpaint(string)   -- same as paint but doesn't append ANSI reset sequence
eansi.nopaint(string)    -- returns string stripped of all color tags and ANSI escapes

-- 
eansi.register(table)    -- put eansi methods toansi, paint, rawpaint and nopaint to table
                         -- monkeypatch eansi to your library
eansi.remove(table)      -- remove eansi methods from table
